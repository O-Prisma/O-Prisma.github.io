## My process

My process to create this design was to make the most identical to the reference I could, it's just my first time doing that
so I guess, for now I can clone the reference image, other than that, I hope you like.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Sometings that I feel like is cool is the learning experience of the box-shadow property, to give
a really subtle effect, in the card.

```css
.card-tag {
    box-shadow: offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color; /* Don't forget, color alpha helps you make it look better! */
}
```

### Continued development

For now, most of the thenics and process in this I guess it's fine, but maybe one day I will comeback and change something
I don't know now, but I will evolve more in the future, so I guess, it will change a bit at some point.
